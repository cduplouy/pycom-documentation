# Pymakr Plugins

To make it as easy as possible to connect to and program your Pycom devices we
have developed a plug-in for
[Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
known as Pymakr.

For more detailed explanation of Pymakr and instructions on how to install and
use it, see the [Pymakr](../../pymakr/README.md) section of the documentation.
