# Required components

In order to use all the features of our modules you may be required to purchase
some additional accessories along with your development module. Below you will
find a quick outline of accessories you might need. If you want more details,
these can be located in the accessories section of the
[products](../products.md) page.

  - **Antennas**:
    - *LoRa (868MHz/915MHz) or Sigfox:* [LoRa/Sigfox antenna]()
    - *LoRa (433MHz):* [LoRa 433Mhz antenna]()
    - *LTE-M or NB-IoT:* [LTE-M antenna]()
    - *WiFi/BT:* All our modules have an on-board antenna so this is *optional*.
  - **USB UART:** We high recommend one of our base boards because they connect
    easily with our modules and greatly simplify the firmware upgrade process:
      - [Expansion board]()
      - [Pytrack]()
      - [Pysense]()

    If you do not wish to purchase one of these you, we still recommend you to
    use a generic UART adapter in order to program the device. Instructions on
    how connect your Pycom development module to a generic UART adapter can
    be found [here.]()
