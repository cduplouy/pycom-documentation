# Connecting your device

This chapter of the documentation will show you how to connect you Pycom module.
For each device there are detailed instructions on how to connect your module to
one of our base boards or a USB UART adapter as well as what antennas you might
need to connect.

### Looking After Your Device
To ensure the longevity of your devices, please be aware of the following:

- Be gentle when plugging/unplugging the USB cable. Whilst the USB connector is
soldered and relatively strong, it can break off and will be difficult to fix.
- Static electricity can damage components on the board and may destroy them.
If there is a lot of static electricity in the area (e.g. dry and cold climates)
, take extra care not to shock the device. If the device came in a ESD bag
(Silver packaging), the best way to store and carry the device is inside this
bag as it will be protected against static discharges.

We highly recommend you update the firmware of your module before trying to use
it. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the
[here.](installation/firmwaretool.md).
